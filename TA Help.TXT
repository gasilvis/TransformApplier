
Welcome to the Transform Applier (TA), a tool prepared for the AAVSO to make it easy to submit 
transformed observations to WebObs. We, members of the AAVSO, want to submit transformed 
observations because these can then be used by professional astronomers. We're amateurs, but 
sophistocated amateurs, and this tool will help us go the next step.

What is required to do this is:   
   - your observations in AAVSO extended format, ready for WebObs submission
   - transform coefficients appropriate for your observing platform
   That's it!

Once you have set your coefficients into TA, you load your observations into the program, hit
the Process button and, voila, you have a transformed, AAVSO extended format, file ready for
submission.

Please note: Ensemble observations are not transformable with this tool. There are ways
to do transformed ensembles and TA may be an aid to this. But the process is not yet
documented.

The details:

- This is a simple windows application that will run on WinXP or better. For you Mac or Linux
users, you should be able to run it in a virtual Windows environment or with Wine.

- Your computer will need internet access so that TA can fetch standard magnitudes for your comp
stars.

- Comp and check stars should be identified by their AUID's. If you have used the chart labels,
that might work too. The problem is that there are often duplicate labels on a chart. TA will 
try to identify the labels and warn you if there is a duplicates problem. Worse comes to worse,
you can insert the comp stars magnitude into the observation file by adding a comment line
before the first line that that refers to that comp that looks like:
"#CREFMAG= <Cmag> <Cerr> <Kmag> <Kerr>". Note that you can include the Check star data too. If 
you only need to provide the check star, you can use "#KREFMAG= <Kmag> <Kerr>"

- Transform coefficients: a notation note
Txy is a coefficient (called color or secondary) of the form:
    1/ slope of (x-y) vs (X-Y)   of your standard star field data.
    where lower case variables are observed mags, capitalized are standard mags.
    eg.  Tbv is 1/ slope of (b-v) vs (B-V)
Tx_yz is a coefficient (called star or primary) of the form:
    slope of (X-x) vs (Y-Z)
    eg.  Tb_bv is slope of (B-b) vs (B-V)
(nb. the AAVSO is working on a tool to help you calculate your coefficients from a set of
observations of a standard field like M67)

- The AAVOS recommended transforms that the TA performs require the following coefficients:
for      U       B       V       R       I
UBVRI  Tu_ub   Tb_bv   Tv_bv   Tr_vi   Ti_vi
UBVI   Tu_ub   Tb_bv   Tv_bv           Ti_vi
UBV    Tu_ub   Tb_bv   Tv_bv
BVRI           Tb_bv   Tv_bv   Tr_vi   Ti_vi
BVR            Tb_bv   Tv_bv   Tvr
BVI            Tb_bv   Tv_bv           Ti_vi
VRI                    Tv_vi   Tr_vi   Tvi
BV             Tb_bv   Tv_bv
VR                     Tv_vr   Tr_vr
VI                     Tv_vi           Tvi
To transform your data you need to group your observations. Above is the list of groupings that
are supported and the coefficients that are required. If you have not loaded these into the
coefficients page, you will get a complaint from TA.
- The Alternate transform equation set uses:
for      U       B       V       R       I
UBVRI   Tub    Tbv     Tv_bv   Tvr     Tri
UBVR    Tub    Tb_bv   Tbv     Tvr
UBVI    Tub    Tb_bv   Tbv             Tvi
BVRI           Tbv     Tv_bv   Tvr     Tri
BVR            Tb_bv   Tbv     Tvr
BVI            Tb_bv   Tbv             Tvi
VRI                    Tv_vr   Tvr     Tri
BV             Tb_bv   Tbv
VR                     Tv_vr   Tvr
VI                     Tv_vi           Tvi
- The classic transform equations from the literature are:
for      U       B       V       R       I
BVRI           Tr_ri, Tri, Tv_vr, Tvr and Tbv   deprecated
BVR            Tbv     Tv_vr   Tvr
BVI            Tbv     Tv_vi           Tvi
VRI            Tr_ri, Tri, Tv_vr and Tvr        deprecated
BV             Tb_bv   Tbv
VR                     Tv_vr   Tvr
VI                     Tv_vi           Tvi
Classic BVRI and VRI are deprecated because they use too many coefficients, one more than is
needed. This reduces the value of the result.

- Coefficient error values: Yes, you should submit the errors related to your coefficients. The
TA will propagate them into the final error of the observation. If you have used an Excel
spreadsheet and the LINEST function, extract the error with (eg) =INDEX(LINEST
(b_v,Bref_Vref,1,1),2,1) that is, the se, standard error, of the slope estimate.
PTGP provides this error value for you.

- Error computations: TA will compute a revised observation error based on the VERR you 
submitted (which should be the instrumental errors of star and comp combined in quadrature)
and the error of the transform coefficient. Note that the error of the comp reference 
magnitude is not included in the final error. This conforms to the WebObs/AID standard 
for reporting errors.

- TA stores your constants in the transformer.ini file alongside the Transformer.exe file. If
you have more than one set of coefficients, corresponding to a different observing platform, you
may have multiple INI files. Set the data on the coefficients page and execute "save as". You
can change back to other ini files with the "change" button. TA will remember the last ini file
that you accessed.

- Extinction: Extinction is important, but this formulation of the transform process cancels out
extinction because it assumes the target and comp star are at the same airmass. So, extinction
is kept turned off. Future versions of TA will be able to adjust your data for extinction. This
will depend on giving you a mechanism to specify the airmass of the comp star where it is
different from the target.

- Aggregating your data: If you have multiple observations of a variable star that is
varying 100 times slower than the time span of your observations, then you should aggregate
your data; it will give you better error values. If you are observing a fast variable then
don't aggregate. TA will aggregate your data for you if you check the box. This is
a simple aggregation with the Verr taken as the standard deviation of the mean. If you are
looking for a more sophisticated aggregation, you should use the Boxter program.

- Grouping: You should assign your observations into transform groups. If you do not, TA will
attempt to group them for you. You should review the output to make sure they were grouped in a
reasonable fashion.

- Use of the Std Field check box: If your chartid was generated with the "Would you like a 
Standard Field Chart", then check this box so TA will know how to fetch that data. This is 
an issue with VSP where the chartid is not uniquely defining the chart.

- Test TC checkbox: This is an reality check tool. How good are your transforms? In
theory you should be able to observe a known star and be able to reproduce its published
magnitude. This test will move your K star data into the V position and then when you
process it will transform that observation. The Report tab will then compare your results
with the K stars standard magnitude. If your results don't match within your error or if
there is a systematic deviation, you should check your observation and assumptions
because your system plus coefficients is not able to match standard data.
